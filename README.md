# treap.cpp

## Project Overview

This project implements and analyzes the Treap, a data structure that combines the properties of a Binary Search Tree and a Heap. The project was developed as part of the "Construction and Analysis of Algorithms 2" course at the Faculty of Mathematics. It focuses on the efficiency and applications of the Treap structure in various fields.

## Features

- **Treap Operations**: The project includes implementations of key Treap operations such as search, insert, delete, split, and merge in C++.
- **Performance Analysis**: The time complexity of each operation is analyzed, with a focus on average-case performance.
- **Applications**: The project explores the use of Treaps in different applications, as outlined in the accompanying paper, including database indexing, graph storage optimization, data mining and artificial intelligence algorithms.
